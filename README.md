# Syaoran's Arch Linux Auto Setup (SALAS)

## Installation:

Log in as root user. Run the following:

    curl -L bit.do/salas-sh -o salas.sh
    chmod +x salas.sh
    sh salas.sh

If the first command fails, then try one of these:

    curl -L tinyurl.com/salas-sh -o salas.sh
    curl -L cutt.ly/salas-sh -o salas.sh
    curl https://gitlab.com/justanoobcoder/SALAS/-/raw/master/salas.sh

## What is SALAS?
Syaoran's Arch Linux Auto Script (SALAS) is a script that autoinstalls and sets up config files. SALAS is for Arch or Arch-based distros only. SALAS will install [dwm-syaoran](https://gitlab.com/justanoobcoder/dwm-syaoran) as default window manager. SALAS is not for anybody, it's mostly only for me. Unless you want to use all my config files, don't use this script, it will overwrite all your config files.
