# Syaoran's Arch Ricing Script (SARS)

## What is SARS?

This is nothing to do with SARS-Cov. Syaoran's Arch Ricing Script (SARS) is a script that autoinstalls and sets up config files. SARS is based on [LARBS](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/LARBS). SARS is for Arch or Arch-based distros only. SARS will install [dwm-syaoran](https://gitlab.com/justanoobcoder/dwm-syaoran) as default window manager. SARS is not for anybody, it's mostly only for me. Unless you want to use all my config files, don't use this script, it will overwrite all your config files.

## Installation:

Log in as root user. Run the following:

    bash <(curl -Ls bit.ly/sars-sh)

## Packages

Packages with a "M" are from Arch's main repository. Packages with an "A" are from AUR. Packages with a "G" are from git repository (github or gitlab), it will clone the repository then use `make` to install. Packages with a "Z" are from git repository (github or gilab), it will download the zip file, unzip it and use `make` to install. If you want to install from git repository, "Z" is recommended because some git repos are quite heavy, download a zip file is way faster and sometimes git clone is so freaking slow. Packages with a "P" are from python pip.<br>
Note: packages from github or gitlab must have `Makefile` to use `make`.
